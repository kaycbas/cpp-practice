The assignment isn't complete but I'm not available to work on it tonight so I've tried to demonstrate what is working. 

I standardized the classes and I stored all the incoming and outgoing links as pointers within each webpage object. In the main function (QT.cpp) I put a function that calls on this information and prints everything to the screen so you can see that it was read in and stored properly. 

I made the QT window skeletons which both pop up when the program is run. 

I worked on trying to merge my webpage information with my QT code for hours (I put all my web code into a parent calls 'Web' and then tried to include that) but I could never get it to link right or figure out where to include what without causing overlaps and errors.

If I were able to get a pointer to my 'Web' in my QT window classes, I am fairly certain I could finish up the code, I just can't seem to do this.
